        - Architecture (TCA, MVVM, Coordinator, etc)
        - UI implementation
        - Firebase/Firestore
- Expanding my tech stacks to:
    - Web frontend (Elm, TS/JS)
    - Functional Programming (Haskell)
    - System Programming (Rust)
- Some experience in Backend (PHP, NodeJS, SQL) before iOS
- Agile/Scrum, Pair-programming lover
